# Animations in react using react-Spring

---

# Why Animate?

<Notes>
  - Animations are more important to UX than you might think - No animations are
  better than poor animations - Take time to perfect animation will affect
  buisness down the road
</Notes>

---

# Animation is Art

<Notes>- good animation adds flair to the application</Notes>

---

# CSS Animations

- Linear Easing
- Bezier Easing

<Notes>- Time based animations are hard to control</Notes>

# What are springs ?
![A springy image](https://i.imgur.com/7CCH51r.gif)

---

# Springs are physical

<Notes>- Physical meaning it is based on how motion is with physics</Notes>

---

# Springs are responsive

---

```js
import { useSpring } from 'react-spring';
```

<Notes>the new react-spring api is powered by hooks</Notes>

---

```js
const values = useSpring(props);
```

---

```js
const values = useSpring({
  to: { foo: '0px', bar: 0, baz: `translateX(0)` },
});
```

---

# Forward Props

```js
const values = useSpring({
  foo: '0px',
  bar: 0,
  baz: `translateX(0)`,
});
```

---

# The `animated()` function

```jsx
import { animated } from 'react-spring';

<animated.div style={props} />;
```

---

## Shorthand

```jsx
import { a } from 'react-spring';

<a.div style={props} />;
```

<Notes>
  Any props not recognized by useSpring is forwarded to the `to` prop
</Notes>

---

import Values from './examples/values';

# Numbers

<Values from={0} to={1} interpolate={x => x.toFixed(2)} />

```js
const props = useSpring({ number: 1 });

<a.div>{props.number}</a.div>;
```

<Notes>- Spring animation can accept a variety of values</Notes>

---

# Strings (css values)

<Values from={0} to={359} interpolate={x => `rotateZ(${x.toFixed(0)}deg)`} />

```js
const props = useSpring({ transform: `rotateZ( 359deg )` });

<a.div style={props} />;
```

---

# Strings (mutliple values)

<Values
  from={[0, 0]}
  to={[50, 200]}
  interpolate={(x, y) => `${x.toFixed(0)}px, ${y.toFixed(0)}px`}
/>

```js
const props = useSpring({
  transform: `translate(50px,200px)`,
});

<a.div style={props} />;
```

---

# Strings (hex)

<Values from="#111" to="#333" />

```js
const props = useSpring({
  from: { color: '#111' },
  to: { color: `#333` },
});

<a.div style={props} />;
```

---

# Strings (named colors)

<Values from="red" to="blue" />

```js
const props = useSpring({
  from: { color: 'red' },
  to: { color: 'blue' },
});

<a.div style={props} />;
```

---

# Arrays

<Values
  from={[0, 1, 2, 3]}
  to={[10, 20, 30, 40]}
  interpolate={(w, x, y, z) => `[${[w, x, y, z].map(x => x.toFixed(0))}]`}
/>

```js
const props = useSpring({
  from: {foo: [0, 1, 2, 3]}
  to: {foo: [10, 20, 30, 40]}
 });

<a.div style={props} />;
```

---

import Bar from './examples/bar';

```js
useSpring({ foo: 200 });
```

<Bar />

<Notes>
  - In most animation libraries requires an explicit `from` values.
  - In react-spring the `to` is used as a from value and no animation
  begins on the first render.
</Notes>

---

import Bar2 from './examples/bar2';

```js
const values = useSpring({
  from: { foo: 0 },
  to: { foo: 200 },
});
```

<Bar2 />

<Notes>
  - Adding a `from` prop makes the component animate on render.
</Notes>


---

import { Mass, Velocity, Tension, Friction, Configs } from './examples/config';

```js
const values = useSpring({
  config: {
    mass,
    velocity,
    tension,
    friction,
    ...
  },
});
```

---

# Mass

<Mass />

<Notes>
  More mass you give to an object, the more velocity it needs to speed up
  and more time it needs to slow down
</Notes>

---

# Tension

<Tension />

<Notes>
  - Tension also the stiffness
  - Higher tension makes friction less effective, (more bouncy)
</Notes>

---

# Friction

<Friction />

<Notes>
 - Also known as the damping ratio
 - Higher friction means greater deceleration and less bouncing.
</Notes>

---

# Velocity

<Velocity />

<Notes>
  - The initial speed and direction
  - for gesture based animations
  - will end at the same time even if not the same
</Notes>

---

# Clamp

```
  const values = useSpring({
    config: { clamp: true }
  })
```

<Notes>
  Prevents your animation from overshooting 
</Notes>

---

# Default Configs

```js
import { config } from 'react-spring';
```

<Configs />

---

# Custom interpolation

```jsx
const { foo } = useSpring({ from: {foo: 0}, foo: 200 });
<a.div>{foo.interpolate(x => x + 'px')}</a.div>
```

<Notes>
  - transforms animated value on every animation frame
  - use this to do clamping or converstions, even simulate keyframes
</Notes>

---

# imperative api

```js
const [props, update, stop] = useSpring(() => ({ opacity: 1 }));

const onClick = () => {
  update({ opacity: toggle ? 1 : 0 });
};

// stop the animation
...
stop();
```

---

# Chained animations
```js
  useSpring({ 
    to: async next => await next({x: 100}),
  })
```

```js
  useSpring({ 
    to: [{x: 100}, {y: 100}],
  })
```

---

# A lot more advanced stuff

```js
import {
  useSpring,
  useSprings,
  useTransition,
  useTrail,
  useChain,
  ... } from 'react-spring';
```
